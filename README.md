Introduction
------------
Whatâ€™s StatNLP?
StatNLP Framework is a NLP algorithm framework built on Java. The framework allows various efficient data processing algorithms to be rapidly prototyped. Various low level optimisation routines are all taken care of by the framework. The users only need to focus on model design.

Who are we?
Research Group in the ISTD pillar at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. Researchers in statNLP focus on solving novel research problems in the NLP, machine learning and big data that may surpass traditional boundaries of data science technology.
The statNLP was formed in 2014. Currently, it is led by Prof Lu Wei, consisting of several graduate students and researcher. The group subscribes to the design spirit of SUTD.
Nevertheless, in a short period of time since its inception, the group has built a successful track record of publishing in the top ranked conferences. Members of statNLP also collaborate with external organization such DSO National Laboratory.
